# Voltage logger
Voltage logger project using ESP32, FreeRTOS, I2C, SPI, SD CARD, INA219 and more.

## Features
- The system is controlled by FreeRTOS.
- Button controls the system status (ON/OFF).
- A timer controls the readings.
- When the system is OFF, the LED will be turned off, the timer stops, display will be cleared
  and SPI & file will be closed/free.
- When the system is ON, the LED will be turned on, the timer starts, display will display `LOADING...`,
  and SPI will be reset if it's not the first time the system is on.
- Potentiometer controls the voltage of the resistor through ADC and DAC.
- Latest voltage readings will be shown on the display as an ongoing graph.
- Data will be transferred via SPI to the SD card in batches of 20.
- In case of system OFF in the middle of data transfer to the SD card, data loss will occur.
- System starts with OFF status.

## Installation
